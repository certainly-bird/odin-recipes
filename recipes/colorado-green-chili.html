    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a vegetarian green chili that you find all over Colorado. Goes great over breakfast burritos, cheeseburgers, fried eggs, or anything.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound Hatch chile peppers</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>5 cups vegetable broth</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons ground cumin</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chili powder, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.</li>
        <li>Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil; spread Hatch chile peppers on top.</li>
        <li>Cook under the preheated broiler, turning once, until the skin of the peppers has blackened and blistered, 6 to 8 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and seal tightly with plastic wrap. Let cool, about 20 minutes. Peel and seed peppers; dice flesh.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in diced chile peppers and tomatoes. Cook until heated through, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle flour into the pot.</li>
        <li>Pour broth into the pot; add cumin, chili powder, and salt. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer until flavors combine, at least 30 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Cook's Note</h2>
    <p>Substitute chicken broth for the vegetable broth if desired. Use fresh or frozen chiles shipped from someplace like The Chili Guys. I personally use either Hot Hatch or Pueblo Hot. I also dump in the oil from the bags to add a little extra depth and heat.</p>
